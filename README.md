# Overview
The repository proivdes data and topological analysis for the 50 metro transit networks around the globe.

## 50-metro-transit-network Excel file
The file provides the topology of 50 metro transit networks as node-link connections. each cell in "Link Existance" has a value of  one if there is directed link from "NodeO" to "NodeD", and zero otherwise.

## Topological Characteristics Excel file

The file reports the following topological characteris for each metro transit system:

### Topological Components

$\|N|$: Number of nodes in the network

$\|L|$: Number of links in the network

### Accessibility Measures

$\bar{B}$ : Average link betweennes cenrality

$D$ : Network diameter

$\bar{A}$ : Average length of connected shortest paths

### Connectivity Measures

$\beta$: The number of links to the number of nodes

$\alpha$: The number of link in the network to the number of link in a complete network with the same node size
