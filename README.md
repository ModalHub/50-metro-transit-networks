# Overview
The repository proivdes the topological analysis for 50 metro transit networks around the globe.
For each metro transit system, we report
The number of nodes

$\|N|$: Number of nodes in the network

$\|L|$: Number of links in the network

$C$ : Link betweennes cenrality

$D$ : Network diameter

$\beta$: The number of links to the number of nodes

$\alpha$: The number of link in the network to the number of link in a complete network with the same node size
